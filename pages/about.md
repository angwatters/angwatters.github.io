# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I have been working in publishing for the last eight years. Recently, I was named Assistant Managing Editor of Library Trends, a 70-year-old, peer-reviewed journal published by Johns Hopkins University Press. I love the publishing process, including working with the other editors, authors, and the publishing house. In my coursework towards my MS-LIS degree at the School of Information, University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, USA, I am focused on organization, data, storytelling, and data visualization. My background is in art, and I hold a BFA from New York Universityâ€™s Tisch School of the arts and an MFA in photography from Columbia College Chicago. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my husband and 8-year-old son and hiking in the Shawnee Forest outside of Carbondale, Illinois.
